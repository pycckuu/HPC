In this exercise, you DO NOT write code unless you want to, but watch the
instructor demonstrating live coding. You need to, however, understand the
numerical procedure for solving the 1D diffusion equation, explained in 
the class.

To run the code, proceed with the following. First, set the following 
environment variables

    export PGPLOT_DIR=/home/bge/lib/pgplot
    export PGPLOT_FONT=/home/bge/lib/pgplot
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PGPLOT_DIR

To compile the serial program heat.f90, type

    f95 -o heat heat.f90 -L$PGPLOT_DIR -lpgplot -lX11

To run a compiled program, set either of the environment variables

    export PGPLOT_DEV=/xwindow
    export PGPLOT_DEV=/xs	# To have a persistent windows

Alternatively, this can be set in the source code by calling either of the
following

    call pgbeg(0, "/xwindow", 1, 1)
    call pgbeg(0, "/xs, 1, 1)

To compile the parallel program heat_p.f90, type

    make

To run parallel MPI program

    mpirun -n num_procs ./heat_p
