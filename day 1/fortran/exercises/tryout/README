This folder contains the source files for the following purpose:

* Array creations.
* Math functions.
* Inquire functions.
* Array functions.
* Array operations
* Do loop containing if branch vs. mask and merge().

In this exercise, you don't need to write any code. Just examine the sample
code provided in the folder, understand what each does, compile and run 
it to see the results. You may modify the code and try out if you wish.

To compile a code foo.f90, unless otherwise indicated in the source code,
use command

    f95 foo.f90 -o foo -O2

where -O2 is optional. If f95 is not available, use gfortran or ifort instead.

Some examples use linear algebra libraies. Instructions are given in the
source files.

To run a compiled code, so foo, type

    ./foo
